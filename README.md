This code uses the built-in temperature, humidity, LED, and buzzer components. The sensors send the data to two variables and then I used another variable to convert to fahrenheit. Then the humidity and temperature is sent to the display screen. Finally, an if conditional checks if the humidity is above 70%. If it is the buzzer will go off and an LED will turn off.
